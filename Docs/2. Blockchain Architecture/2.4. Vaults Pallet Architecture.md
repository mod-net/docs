#### Vault Struct
```rust
struct Vault<T: Config> {
	key: AddressIdOf<T>, // Address of vault owner
	id: u64, // ModId
	reserve: u64, // Balance reserved by owner
	passivePaymentAuthorization: bool, // Approval by the vault owner for modules to receive payment without an immediate signature
}
```

With this structure, Vaults would be stored in the chain as a `StorageDoubleMap` with the key and id as the keys for the map.

Vaults established at Mod ID 0 would be reserved and would be considered a "Global Vault" that any mod could pull from, while vaults established with a specific Mod's ID would be only accessible by the Mod registered on that slot.
