#### Commune AI Runtime Upgrade
The chain upgrade for the COM side of the bridging mechanism includes the following mechanisms:
- Users can lock any amount of tokens, specifying with their lockup the period of time that they would like to vest their tokens for after the bridge event.
- Users can unlock their tokens without penalty until the bridge event.
- The Sudo Key will be able to lock the bridging mechanism and prevent any further lockups or unlocks.
